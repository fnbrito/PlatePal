# PlatePal
This project is a recipe-gathering social website, where people can view, share, and comment recipes.
The back end is an API (Python / FastAPI) and the client uses React and Bootstrap.

The project was done in a group of three people originally in Azure DevOps. I copied the project here for visibility.
The project was done in one week using a Kanban board, deviding tasks into Epics, Features, Stories, Work items and bugs.
